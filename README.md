## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Bazel 6.0+
- Basic understanding of Python package management

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RameshOswal/pydata-2025-conference-bazel-ai-pkgs-tutorial.git
   cd pydata-2025-conference-bazel-ai-pkgs-tutorial
   ```

2. Run the examples to verify your setup:

   ```bash
   # Run data processing example
   bazel run //examples/01-data-processing:simple_process_data
   
   # Train ML models
   bazel run //examples/02-basic-ml:ml_pipeline
   
   # Evaluate trained models
   bazel run //examples/03-model-evaluation:model_evaluator
   
   # Run tests to verify everything works
   bazel test //examples/02-basic-ml:test_ml_examples //examples/03-model-evaluation:test_evaluation
   ```

3. Follow the examples in order: data processing → ML training → model evaluation.
